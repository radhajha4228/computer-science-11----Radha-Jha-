    <!-- Information Security Section -->
    <div class="note-section">
        <h2>Information Security</h2>
        <p>Information security (InfoSec) refers to the processes and methods employed to protect sensitive and valuable data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. It encompasses various measures and technologies to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.</p>

        <h3>Key Concepts of Information Security</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to view it.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Ensuring that information is accurate and unaltered except by authorized personnel.</li>
            <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring that information is accessible and usable when needed by authorized users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Types of Information Security Threats</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software designed to harm or exploit a system. Examples include viruses, worms, and ransomware.</li>
            <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Fraudulent attempts to acquire sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy entity.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Manipulating individuals into revealing confidential information.</li>
            <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> Attacks that overwhelm a system, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Measures for Information Security</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> The process of converting information into a code to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> Security systems that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Restricting access to information based on the permissions granted to users.</li>
            <li><strong>Antivirus Software:</strong> Programs designed to detect and eliminate malicious software.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Backup:</strong> Regularly saving copies of critical data to recover from potential data loss or cyberattacks.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Cyber Law Section -->
    <div class="note-section">
        <h2>Cyber Law</h2>
        <p>Cyber Law, also known as Internet Law or IT Law, refers to the legal regulations that govern the use of the internet and online activities. It involves legal aspects related to the protection of online privacy, data security, intellectual property rights, and more.</p>

        <h3>Key Areas of Cyber Law</h3>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Intellectual Property Rights:</strong> Laws that protect creations of the mind such as inventions, literary works, and trademarks from unauthorized use.</li>
            <li><strong>Cybercrimes:</strong> Criminal activities carried out through the internet, including hacking, identity theft, and online fraud.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> Electronic signatures used to verify the authenticity of digital documents.</li>
            <li><strong>Cybersecurity Regulations:</strong> Legal requirements aimed at ensuring the security of computer networks and systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cybercrimes and Legal Framework</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hacking:</strong> Unauthorized access to computer systems or networks with the intent to steal, alter, or destroy data.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Important Cyber Laws</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Information Technology Act, 2000 (India):</strong> A comprehensive law that governs electronic transactions, cybercrimes, and digital signatures. It provides legal recognition to electronic records and signatures.</li>
            <li><strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU):</strong> A regulation that governs the collection and processing of personal data of individuals in the European Union.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) (USA):</strong> A law that provides copyright protection to digital content and establishes penalties for online piracy and infringement.</li>
